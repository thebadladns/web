      h4 What is it
      p The Badladns is an unstructured, unmanaged, and totally underfunded art collective.
      p We badladners do things together, or maybe alone and introspectively.
      p We can handle small projects and big projects, and whatever we do, we do it because we believe in doing it.
      p We are weird, we enjoy that, and we are glad you are here.
      p Welcome to the Badladns ‚ù§
      h4 What do we do
      p We do art
      p We do videogames

      p We do help others do things
      h4 Who are we
      p The badladns is founded by these two handsome lads:
